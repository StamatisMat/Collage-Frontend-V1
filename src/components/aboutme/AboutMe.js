        My name is Stamatis, I'm a Computer Science & Engineering graduate, was born in 1999 and I'm currently looking for my first Software Develompent Role.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for computers started from the very young age of 2, where my parents got me to experience some video games for children that came about in Greece. 
        Playing videogames and learning skills(such as blind typing and simple coding in "pawno") from videogames was my hobby until age 18 where I graduated from High School
        and got in University of Ioannina, in the department of Computer Science & Engineering. There I learned my technical skills (algorithmic analysis, Java, Python) but
        the most important skill I've learned is to learn effectively and efficiently. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My years being a student ended in September of 2022 with a diploma thesis using Deep Learning called: <a className='paragraph-link' href='https://github.com/StamatisMat/Deep-Textures-TensorFlow' target='blank'>
        Restoration of Ancient Artifacts using Deep Learning</a>.
        My goals were to learn to become a better reasearch scientist, to give a useful tool to everyone in the computer science community,
        as well as to advance my coding and presentation skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I graduated from University, I served in the IT Department of the Hellenic Army as an IT Technician for my mandatory military service. During my service I learned
        many technical skills, such as soldering in components to pcbs, repairing various machines (computers, servers, printers, chairs etc.) with a strict budget of resources
        but the most important skill I learned was discipline. Discipline fuels my motivation to better myself every day. 
        Various other soft skills I've practiced during my service were Team-Playing, Time Manageement and Conflict Management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, my days are spent doing the thing I love the most, that is coding, while also practicing my hobbies, which are Photography, Music Playing & Production,
        Swimming and Cooking!
      </p>
      <p>
        For the future, I'd like to provide my best efforts and become the best developer I can, so I can become a valued member within a skilled team in a great company!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for reading this and I hope we can collaborate soon.
